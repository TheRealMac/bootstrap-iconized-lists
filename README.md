bootstrap-iconized-lists
========================

helps easily to create unordered lists with the Bootstrap Icons as list item bullets.
Just by adding the class to the unordered list.

Works for child lists too and it's possible to use other icons for child lists

the class has to begin with list-icon-

i.e. if you like to use icon-plus as bullet just use


<pre>
&lt;ul class='list-icon-plus'&gt;
  &lt;li>...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
